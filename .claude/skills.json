Use conventional commit format: type(scope): subject\n2. Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore\n3. Keep subject under 72 characters\n4. Include detailed body if changes are complex\n5. List breaking changes if any\n6. Add Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>\n\nFor this project:\n- Use Chinese for A-share related features (A股晨报、市场数据等)\n- Use English for technical changes (API, refactoring, etc.)\n- Mention specific services if modified (e.g., us_stocks.py, generator.py)"

For this project, focus on:\n   - API endpoint tests (main.py routes)\n   - Data source tests (akshare, yfinance)\n   - Service layer tests (services/*.py)\n   - Cache mechanism tests\n4. Analyze failures and suggest fixes\n5. Report coverage statistics"

For this project (Vite + React):\n   - Keep components in web/src/components/\n   - Use Lucide React for icons (already installed)\n   - Maintain consistent styling approach\n   - Handle loading and error states\n3. When creating components:\n   - Props validation with PropTypes or TypeScript\n   - Meaningful component and prop names\n   - Extract reusable logic to custom hooks\n   - Keep components focused (single responsibility)\n4. Data fetching:\n   - Use existing dataCache.js service\n   - Implement proper loading states\n   - Handle errors gracefully\n   - Consider implementing SWR pattern\n5. Performance:\n   - Lazy load heavy components\n   - Virtualize long lists\n   - Optimize bundle size (code splitting)"
